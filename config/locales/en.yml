        ineligible_reason:
          misconduct: To teach in England, you must not have any findings of misconduct or restrictions on your practice.
          recognised: This is because you are not recognised as a school teacher in the country where you trained.
          teach_children: You must have experience of teaching children who are aged somewhere between 5 and 16 years.
          qualification: This is because you have not completed a formal teacher training course, for example, an undergraduate degree or postgraduate teacher training course.
          degree: This is because you do not have a degree. As teaching in England is a graduate profession, you must have an undergraduate degree. Tell us if you have a degree.
          country: This is because teachers with qualifications from this country are not eligible under current legislation. The Department for Education is currently reviewing these rules.
