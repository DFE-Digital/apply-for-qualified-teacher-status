  Check your eligibility to apply for qualified teacher status (QTS) in England
</h1>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What QTS is</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Qualified teacher status (QTS) is a legal requirement to teach in many English schools, and most schools prefer their teachers to have it.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you apply for QTS we’ll assess the teacher training and experience you gained outside of England to decide whether you’re qualified to teach in English schools.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Having QTS does not guarantee you a job or give you the right to work in England. You’ll still need to apply for a teaching job separately and have the correct visa or status.</p>
