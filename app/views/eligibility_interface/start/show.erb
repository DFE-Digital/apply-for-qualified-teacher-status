<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About QTS</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">QTS is a legal requirement to teach in many schools in England. It is a status that most schools prefer their teachers to have. <%= govuk_link_to "Find out more about QTS", "https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts" %>.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">It does not guarantee you a job or give you the right to work in England. You’ll still need to apply for a teaching job separately and have the correct visa or status.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to apply for QTS</h2>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">

<p class="govuk-body">Your teaching qualifications and experience will be assessed against strict requirements. These requirements are mandatory and must be met in full. The process is designed to ensure we only award QTS to the highest quality teachers. This means it can take time.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Information correct as of July 2024. Timelines are based on total applications completed since February 2023.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">It may take longer if we need to ask for further information or if external factors, or third parties, cause delays. This includes waiting for references, or verification of qualifications or professional standing. The time it takes to assess applications is regularly reviewed and subject to change.</p>
