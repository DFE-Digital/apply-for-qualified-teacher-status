  <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">You’ve told us about <%= pluralize(@months_count, "month") %> of work experience so far</h1>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">How we calculate your work experience</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">We use a 30-hour working week to calculate your experience.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">If you add a role where you worked <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">under</span> 30 hours per week, we’ll convert the hours you enter into 30-hour weeks. That means the number of months you’ve added so far may be smaller than you expected.</p>

  <div class="govuk-inset-text">
    For example, if you tell us about a role where you worked 15 hours per week for 18 months, we’ll convert this to 9 months of 30-hour weeks. We’ll then add this role to your total as 9 months.
  </div>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Adding more roles</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body">You can add as many roles as you want, but you must show at least 9 months of active teaching experience.</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>If you have more than 9 months but under 20, you may be awarded QTS, but you’ll need to do a 2-year period of statutory induction.</li>
    <li>If you have more than 20 months, there’s no need to do an induction period.</li>
  </ul>

  <%= govuk_details(summary_text: "I do not have more than 9 months of teaching experience") do %>
    <p class="govuk-body">QTS requires a minimum of 9 months of active teaching experience. We can keep your application open for 6 months, so you can continue later, if you gain enough experience in that time.</p>
