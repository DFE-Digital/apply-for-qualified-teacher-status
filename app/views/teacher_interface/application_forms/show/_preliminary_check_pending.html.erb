<p class="govuk-body">
  We need to carry out some initial checks on your application. We will email you to let you know if your application passes these initial checks.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  If initial checks are passed you will need to request <%= region_certificate_phrase(view_object.region) %> from <%= region_teaching_authority_name_phrase(view_object.region) %>.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Do not request your <%= region_certificate_name(view_object.region) %> until you have received confirmation from us. You do not need to contact us.â€¨
