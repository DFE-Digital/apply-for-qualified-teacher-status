# Privacy notice

## Who we are

The <%= t(current_namespace, scope: %i[service name]) %> service is run by the [Teaching Regulation Agency
(TRA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/teaching-regulation-agency/about),
an executive agency of the Department for Education (DfE).

Our service allows anyone to check whether they might be eligible to receive qualified teacher status (QTS) in England.

For the purpose of data protection legislation, DfE is the data controller for
the data we hold and process.

## What data we collect

We collect information on the answers that people give to the eligibility questions. We do not currently collect any personally identifiable information.

### Why we need your data

We use it to determine whether someone might be eligible to receive qualified teacher status (QTS) in England.

## Our legal basis for processing your data

So that our use of your personal data is lawful, we need to meet one (or more)
conditions in the data protection legislation. For our service, this is:

- article 6(1)(e) UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), to perform a
  public task carried out in the public interest as part of our function as a
  department

### What we do with your data

We use the data you give us to determine whether you might be eligible to receive qualified teacher status (QTS) in England. This allows you to apply for teaching jobs or access other DfE services.

We might also use your details when analysing data to improve the service.

We use GOV.UK PaaS to run the service. [Visit the GOV.UK PaaS website](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/privacy-notice/#what-data-we-collect-from-end-users) to find out how they use and look after your data.

## How long we keep your data

We'll keep a record of who has checked their eligibility status, and how many requests have been made, for up to 2 years.

## Your data protection rights

You have the right:

- to ask us what information we hold about you
- to have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete
- to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no
  compelling reason for its continued processing
- to restrict our processing of your personal data (for instance, to allow us to
  store it but not process it further)
- to object to direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for the
  purposes of scientific or historical research and statistics
- not to be subject to decisions based purely on automated processing where it
  produces a legal or similarly significant effect on you.

If you have any questions about how we’ll use your personal information,

and enter ‘Data protection enquiry’ as a reference.

### Consent and how to make a complaint

explicitly seek your consent to process your data.
