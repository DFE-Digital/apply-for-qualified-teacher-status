# Privacy notice

## Who we are

The <%= t('service.name') %> service is run by the [Teaching Regulation Agency
(TRA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/teaching-regulation-agency/about),
an executive agency of the Department for Education (DfE).

Our service allows anyone with a teacher reference number (TRN) to get a
reminder of their TRN by email.

For the purpose of data protection legislation, DfE is the data controller for
the data we hold and process.

## What data we collect

### Why we need your data

## Our legal basis for processing your data

So that our use of your personal data is lawful, we need to meet one (or more)

  public task carried out in the public interest as part of our function as a
  department

### What we do with your data

## How long we keep your data

## Your data protection rights

You have the right:

- to ask us what information we hold about you
- to have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete
- to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no
  compelling reason for its continued processing
- to restrict our processing of your personal data (for instance allow us to
  store it but not process it further)
- to object to direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for the
  purposes of scientific or historical research and statistics
- not to be subject to decisions based purely on automated processing where it
  produces a legal or similarly significant effect on you
