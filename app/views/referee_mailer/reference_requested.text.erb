Dear <%= @work_history.contact_name %>

We need you to confirm some information about <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %> as part of their application for qualified teacher status (QTS) in England.

As part of the QTS application process, our assessors need to understand each applicant’s work history and experience.

<%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %> has given us your name and email address to help us confirm that the information they’ve provided about their work history and experience is accurate.

Please follow the link below and answer the questions by <%= @reference_request.expired_at.strftime("%e %B %Y") %>.

<%= teacher_interface_reference_request_url(@reference_request) %>

It should take no longer than 5 minutes.

Kind regards,
The Teacher Qualifications Team (part of the Teaching Regulation Agency)
