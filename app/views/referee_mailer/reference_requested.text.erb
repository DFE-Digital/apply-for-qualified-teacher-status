Dear <%= @work_history.contact_name %>

We need you to confirm some information about <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %> as part of their application for qualified teacher status (QTS) in England.

As part of the QTS application process, our assessors need to understand each applicant’s work history and experience.

<%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %> has given us your name and email address to help us confirm that the information they’ve provided about their work history and experience is accurate.

# About QTS

<%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %> is NOT applying for a job – their QTS application just allows us to assess their qualifications and teaching experience to understand whether they can teach in England.

# What we need you to do

Please follow the link below and answer the questions by <%= @reference_request.expired_at.to_date.to_fs(:long_ordinal_uk) %>.

<%= teacher_interface_reference_request_url(@reference_request.slug) %>

It should take no longer than 5 minutes.

Kind regards,
The Teacher Qualifications Team
(an executive agency sponsored by the Department for Education, England)
