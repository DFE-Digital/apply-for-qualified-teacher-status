# About QTS

QTS is a legal requirement to teach in many English schools, and most schools prefer their teachers to have it.

<%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %> has not applied for a job. Having QTS does not guarantee a job or give someone the right to work in England.

The QTS application allows us to assess a person’s teacher training and experience to understand if they have the skills and qualifications needed to gain QTS in England.

Kind regards,
The Professional Recognition team, Apply for QTS in England
(an executive agency sponsored by the Department for Education, England)
