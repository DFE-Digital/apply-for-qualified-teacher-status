Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

## We’ve contacted your references to confirm you have valid work experience in England

<%= render "shared/teacher_mailer/reference_number" %>

To confirm if your application can be prioritised, we've contacted the following references you named in your application:
<% @prioritisation_reference_requests.each do |prioritisation_reference_request| %>
* <%= prioritisation_reference_request.work_history.school_name %>, <%= prioritisation_reference_request.work_history.job %>, <%= prioritisation_reference_request.work_history.school_name %>,
<% end %>

They need to respond by <%= @prioritisation_reference_requests.first.expires_at.to_date.to_fs %>.

To help avoid delays:
* contact your references to make sure they’ve received the request
* ask them to check their junk or spam folder if they haven’t seen it

If they have not received the request, email [<%= t("service.email.enquiries") %>](mailto:<%= t("service.email.enquiries") %>).

<%= render "shared/teacher_mailer/footer" %>
