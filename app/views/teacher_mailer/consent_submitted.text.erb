Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

Thank you for submitting the consent documents required to progress your QTS application.

<%= render "shared/teacher_mailer/reference_number" %>

## What happens next?

Once an assessor has checked the documents to make sure you’ve provided the required information, they’ll continue reviewing your application.

If no further information is needed, we’ll contact you with a final QTS application decision once all checks and verifications have been completed.
