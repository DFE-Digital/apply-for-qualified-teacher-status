<%= @application_form.reference %>

# What happens next

<% if @application_form.teaching_authority_provides_written_statement %>
When we’ve received the written evidence you’ve requested from your teaching authority, we’ll add your application to the queue to be assigned to a QTS assessor — this can take several weeks.
<% else %>
Your application will be entered into a queue and assigned a QTS assessor, which can take several weeks.

Once assigned, the assessor will aim to review your application within 1 month. If we need more information, we’ll email you again.

We aim to reach a final decision on QTS applications within 80 working days (4 months) of submission.
