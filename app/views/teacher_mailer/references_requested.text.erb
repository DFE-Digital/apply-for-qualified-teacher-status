Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>

Weâ€™ve contacted the references you provided to verify the work history information you gave as part of your QTS application.

They need to respond by <%= @reference_requests.first.expires_at.to_date.to_fs(:long_ordinal_uk) %>. If your references do not respond, and, as a result, we cannot verify your work history, we may not be able to award you QTS.

Contact them to make sure they have received the request. They may need to check their junk email folder.

If they have not received the request, email QTS.Enquiries@education.gov.uk
