# What happens next

Your application will be entered into a queue and assigned a QTS assessor, which can take several weeks.

Once assigned, the assessor will aim to review your application within 1 month. If we need more information, we’ll email you again.

We aim to reach a final decision on QTS applications within 80 working days (4 months) of submission.
