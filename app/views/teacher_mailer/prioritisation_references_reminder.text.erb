Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

## We’re still waiting for a response from one or more of the references you provided to confirm your work experience in England.

<% if @number_of_reminders_sent == 0 %>
We contacted your references on <%= @prioritisation_reference_requests.first.requested_at.to_date.to_fs %> but have not received a response from:
<% elsif @number_of_reminders_sent == 1 %>
The following references have just 2 weeks to respond to the reference request.
<% end %>

<% @prioritisation_reference_requests.each do |reference_request| %>
- <%= reference_request.work_history.contact_name %> — <%= reference_request.work_history.school_name %>
<% end %>

They need to respond by <%= @prioritisation_reference_requests.first.expires_at.to_date.to_fs %>. If your references do not respond then we won’t be able to confirm your work experience in England and your application won’t be prioritised. This means your application will be assessed within our standard timelines. You should contact your reference to remind them about the request.
