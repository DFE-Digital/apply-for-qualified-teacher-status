Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

# We’ve received your application for qualfied teacher status (QTS) in England

<%= render "shared/teacher_mailer/reference_number" %>

# What happens next

First, we’ll confirm if your experience in England is valid and if your application can be prioritised.

We’ll email you to confirm if your application will be prioritised or not, and to confirm when you should request your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> from <%= region_teaching_authority_name_phrase(@application_form.region) %>.

Do not request your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> until you have received confirmation from us. You do not need to contact us.
