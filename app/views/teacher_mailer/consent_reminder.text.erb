Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

We recently wrote to you asking for your consent to verify some of your qualifications as part of your QTS application.

We have not received your consent documents. If you do not send them by <%= @expires_at.to_date.to_fs %> we will not be able to proceed with your application.

## What you need to do

Download each document, then:

- print it
- sign it, making sure your signature is clear
- scan or photograph it
- upload the signed document

<% if FeatureFlags::FeatureFlag.active?(:gov_one_applicant_login) %>
# Signing in to your application
Youâ€™ll now need a GOV.UK One Login to sign in. If you don't have one you can create one, but you must use the same email as your QTS sign in to access your application.

[Create your GOV.UK One Login or sign in](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>)
<% else %>
[Sign in to access your documents](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>)
<% end %>

## Why we need your written consent

We need your written consent so we can share your data with organisations that can verify your qualifications. This is in accordance with UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
