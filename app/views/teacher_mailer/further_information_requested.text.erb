Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

The assessor reviewing your QTS application needs more information.

The assessor needs this information by <%= @further_information_request.expires_at.to_date.to_fs %> for your application to proceed.

# What you need to do
<% if FeatureFlags::FeatureFlag.active?(:gov_one_applicant_login) %>
You will need to sign in to your application to see what information is needed and add it.

# Signing in to your application
Youâ€™ll now need a GOV.UK One Login to sign in. If you don't have one you can create one, but you must use the same email as your QTS sign in to access your application.

[Create your GOV.UK One Login or sign in](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>)
<% else %>
[Sign in to your application](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>)
<% end %>

Your application is on hold until this information is received. Once you respond with all the information requested, the assessor will be able to continue reviewing your application.
