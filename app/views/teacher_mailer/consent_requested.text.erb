Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

As part of your QTS application we need to verify some of your qualifications. To allow us to do this you need to sign and return a consent document for each qualification we need to verify.

Consent documents have been added to your application.

## What you need to do

Download each document then:

- print it
- sign it, making sure your signature is clear
- scan or photograph it
- upload the signed document

[Sign in to access your documents](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>)

You need to sign and upload these documents by <%= @expires_at.to_fs(:date) %> so that we can proceed with your application.

## Why we need your written consent

We need your written consent so we can share your data with organisations that can verify your qualifications. This is in accordance with UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
