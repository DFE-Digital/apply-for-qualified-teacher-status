Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>

## We’re still waiting for a response from one or more of the references you provided to verify your work history.

<% if @number_of_reminders_sent == 0 %>
We contacted your references on <%= @reference_requests.first.requested_at.to_date.to_fs(:long_ordinal_uk) %> but have not received a response from:
<% elsif @number_of_reminders_sent == 1 %>
The following references have just 2 weeks to respond to the reference request.
<% end %>

<% @reference_requests.each do |reference_request| %>
- <%= reference_request.work_history.contact_name %> — <%= reference_request.work_history.school_name %>
<% end %>

They need to respond by <%= @reference_requests.first.expires_at.to_date.to_fs(:long_ordinal_uk) %>. If your references do not respond, and, as a result, we cannot verify your work history, we may not be able to award you QTS. You should contact your reference to remind them about the request.
