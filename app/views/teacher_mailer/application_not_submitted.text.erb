Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

<% case @number_of_reminders_sent %>
<% when 0 %>
We’ve noticed that you have a draft application for qualified teacher status (QTS) that has not been submitted.

We need to let you know that if you do not complete and submit your application by <%= @application_form.expires_at.to_date.to_fs(:long_ordinal_uk) %> we’ll delete the application.
<% when 1 %>
We contacted you a week ago about your draft application for qualified teacher status (QTS).

If you do not complete and submit your application by <%= @application_form.expires_at.to_date.to_fs(:long_ordinal_uk) %> we’ll delete the application.
<% end %>

# What happens if your application is deleted?

We’re required to delete any QTS applications that are not submitted within 6 months of being started.

Applications are deleted permanently, so if you still wanted to apply for QTS after that date, you’d need to begin a brand new application.

# Your next steps

If you still want to apply for QTS you must do so before <%= @application_form.expires_at.to_date.to_fs(:long_ordinal_uk) %>. You can sign in to complete and submit your application using the link below:

<%= new_teacher_session_url %>

If you no longer want to apply, you do not need to take any action.

<%= render "shared/teacher_mailer/footer" %>
