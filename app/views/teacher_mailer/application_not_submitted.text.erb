We recently contacted you about your draft application for qualified teacher status (QTS) in England that has not been submitted.

Applications need to be submitted within 6 months of being started. If you do not complete and submit your application by <%= @application_form.expires_at.to_date.to_fs %> it will be deleted.
<% end %>

# What happens if your application is deleted?

If you do not submit your application before the above date it will be deleted permanently. If you still want to apply for QTS after that date you’ll need to start a new application.

# What you can do
<% if FeatureFlags::FeatureFlag.active?(:gov_one_applicant_login) %>
If you still want to apply for QTS you must do so by <%= @application_form.expires_at.to_date.to_fs %>. You will need to sign in to complete and submit your application.

# Signing in to your application
You’ll now need a GOV.UK One Login to sign in. If you don't have one you can create one, but you must use the same email as your QTS sign in to access your application.
