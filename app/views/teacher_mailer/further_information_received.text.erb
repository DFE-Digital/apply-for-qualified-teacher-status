# What happens next

A trained assessor will continue to assess your application. They will check all the information you have submitted. Some information may need verification by third parties.

If we need more information, we will email you. You do not need to contact us.

You will get a decision about your QTS application when the assessment and all verifications have been completed. We will not be able to give individual updates on the status of your application while it is being assessed.
