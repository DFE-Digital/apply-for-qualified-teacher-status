Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

# Weâ€™ve received your application for qualfied teacher status (QTS) in England

<%= render "shared/teacher_mailer/reference_number" %>

# What happens next

We need to carry out some initial checks on your application. We will email you to let you know if your application passes these initial checks.

If initial checks are passed you will need to request a <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> from <%= region_teaching_authority_name_phrase(@application_form.region) %>.

Do not request your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> until you have received confirmation from us. You do not need to contact us.
