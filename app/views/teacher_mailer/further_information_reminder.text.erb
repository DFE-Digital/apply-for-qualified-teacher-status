Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

We recently contacted you about more information needed by the assessor reviewing your QTS application.

We haven’t received the information requested. Your application cannot proceed without this information. If you do not respond by <%= @further_information_request.expires_at.to_date.to_fs %> then your QTS application will be declined.

# What you need to do

<% if FeatureFlags::FeatureFlag.active?(:gov_one_applicant_login) %>
You will need to sign in to your application to see what information is needed and add it.

# Signing in to your application
You’ll now need a GOV.UK One Login to sign in. If you don't have one you can create one, but you must use the same email as your QTS sign in to access your application.

[Create your GOV.UK One Login or sign in](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>)
<% else %>
Sign in using the link below to see what information is needed and add it.

[Sign in to your application](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>)
<% end %>

Once you respond with all the information requested, the assessor will be able to continue reviewing your application.
