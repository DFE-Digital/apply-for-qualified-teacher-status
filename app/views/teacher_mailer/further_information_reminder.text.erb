Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

We recently contacted you about more information needed by the assessor reviewing your QTS application.

We haven’t received the information requested. Your application cannot proceed without this information.

# What you need to do

You need to sign in to your application to submit the information.

<% if view_object.further_information_request.third_request? %>
  You must submit this information by 11:59pm <%= @further_information_request.expires_at.in_time_zone('Europe/London').strftime('%Z') %> on <%= @further_information_request.expires_at.to_date.to_fs %> or your application will be declined.
<% else %>
  This is your final opportunity to provide the required information. You must submit this information by 11:59pm <%= @further_information_request.expires_at.in_time_zone('Europe/London').strftime('%Z') %> on <%= @further_information_request.expires_at.to_date.to_fs %> or your application will be declined.
<% end %>

<% if FeatureFlags::FeatureFlag.active?(:gov_one_applicant_login) %>
# Signing in to your application

You’ll now need a GOV.UK One Login to sign in. If you don't have one you can create one, but you must use the same email as your QTS sign in to access your application.

[Create your GOV.UK One Login or sign in](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>)
<% else %>
Sign in using the link below to see what information is needed and add it.

[Sign in to your application](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>)
<% end %>

Once you respond with all the information requested, the assessor will be able to continue reviewing your application.
