Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

<%= render "shared/teacher_mailer/reference_number" %>

Thank you for applying for QTS in England. Unfortunately, your application has been declined.

# Reason for decline

<% @view_object.declined_reasons.each do |title, reasons| %>
<% if title.present? %>
## <%= title %>

<% end %>
<% reasons.each do |reason| %>
<%= reason[:name] %>

<% if reason[:assessor_note].present? %>
<%= reason[:assessor_note] %>

<% end %>
<% end %>
<% end %>
<% unless @view_object.declined_cannot_reapply? || @view_object.from_ineligible_country? %>
# What you can do next

You’ll be able to make a new application for QTS once you've addressed the decline reasons we've given. If you reapply for QTS, you’ll not be able to review the details of your previous application.

# Decision review

Applicants who have been declined for QTS are entitled to a review of the decline decision by a Casework Manager.
If you would like to request a decision review, you’ll need to provide:

- formal evidence and reasoning as to how you meet the required assessment criteria
- additional information not included in your original application that would support your decision review

Your request for review must be received within 28 days of receipt of the decision to decline QTS. Email your request for review, including the information required as above, to [<%= t("service.email.enquiries") %>](mailto:<%= t("service.email.enquiries") %>).

If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the decision review, you can request a final formal appeal to a senior Teacher Qualification Manager.

[Sign in](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>) to review the outcome of your application.
