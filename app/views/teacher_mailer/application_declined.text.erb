Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

Thank you for applying for qualified teacher status (QTS) and for your patience while we reviewed your application. Your application has been declined.

# Reasons your application has been declined

<% @view_object.declined_reasons.each do |title, reasons| %>
<% next if reasons.empty? %>

<% if title.empty? %>
<% reasons.each do |reason| %>
<%= reason[:name] %>
<% end %>
<% else %>
## <%= title %>

<% reasons.each do |reason| %>
^ <%= reason[:name] %>

<% if reason[:assessor_note].present? %>
Note from assessor:
<%= reason[:assessor_note] %>
<% end %>

<% end %>
<% end %>
<% end %>

<% unless @view_object.declined_cannot_reapply? %>
# What you can do next
You can explore [other routes into teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/routes-into-teaching).

<% unless @view_object.from_ineligible_country? %>
Or, you’ll be able to make a new application once you've addressed all decline reasons given. If you reapply for QTS, you’ll not be able to review the details of your previous application.
<% end %>
<% end %>

<% unless @view_object.from_ineligible_country? %>
<% unless @view_object.declined_cannot_reapply? %>
<% if @view_object.has_any_further_information_decline_reasons? %>
# Information we’ll need if you reapply

<% @view_object.assessment_further_information_reasons.each do |title, reasons| %>
<% next if reasons.empty? %>

<% if title.present? %>
## <%= title %>
<% end %>

<% reasons.each do |reason| %>
^ <%= reason[:name] %>

<% if reason[:assessor_note].present? %>
Note from assessor:
<%= reason[:assessor_note] %>
<% end %>

<% end %>
<% end %>
