Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>

# We’ve performed our initial checks on your application

<%= render "shared/teacher_mailer/reference_number" %>

You should now request your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> from <%= region_teaching_authority_name(@application_form.region) %>. Contact them directly and instruct them to send the document to [<%= t("service.email.verification") %>](mailto:<%= t("service.email.verification") %>).

Once we receive the document, we’ll begin the full assessment of your application.

# Important information about your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %>

Sign in to see important information about your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> before you request it.

<%= new_teacher_session_url %>

# What happens next

We will contact you with a final QTS application decision once all checks and verifications have been completed.
