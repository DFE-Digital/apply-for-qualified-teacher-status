Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

# Your application for QTS in England has passed initial checks

You now need to request your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> from <%= region_teaching_authority_name(@application_form.region) %>. 

Contact them directly and ask them to send the document to [<%= t("service.email.verification") %>](mailto:<%= t("service.email.verification") %>).

# Information about your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> 
Sign in to find out more information about your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> before you request it. This could include instructions and fees.

[Sign in to your application](<%= new_teacher_session_url %>)

# What happens next

Once we receive your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %>, your application will be entered into a queue and assigned a QTS assessor. We will email you if we need any further information.

Contact [<%= t("service.email.enquiries") %>](mailto:<%= t("service.email.enquiries") %>) with queries. We aim to respond within 5 working days.
