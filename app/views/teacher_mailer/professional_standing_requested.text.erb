Dear <%= application_form_full_name(@application_form) %>,

# Your application is being prioritised
<% elsif @application_form.requires_preliminary_check %>

# What you need to do

<% if @application_form.assessment.prioritised? %>
We have confirmed your work experience in England. This means your application is being prioritised.
<% end %>

You must now get your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> from <%= region_teaching_authority_name_phrase(@application_form.region) %>. Your application cannot progress until we have received it.

Email <%= @application_form.region.teaching_authority_emails.map { |email| "[#{email}](mailto:#{email})" }.to_sentence %> and ask them to send your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> directly to us at [<%= t("service.email.verification") %>](mailto:<%= t("service.email.verification") %>).

You cannot send it yourself.

First, we’ll confirm if your experience in England is valid and if your application can be prioritised. We’ll email you to confirm if your application will be prioritised or not.

Once this has been confirmed and your <%= region_certificate_name(@application_form.region) %> is received and checked, your application will be assessed by a trained assessor. They will check all the information you have submitted. Some information may need verification by third parties.
